This repository integrates the LLM Check implementation from the NeurIPS paper into our WanderTales project.

Since WanderTales relies on the GPT-4 model, it's essential to evaluate the presence of hallucinations in its responses. 
Identifying instances where the model generates inaccurate or fabricated content will help enhance the reliability and overall quality of the travel plans and stories it produces.

This analysis served as a key performance metric for improving our system's output.
